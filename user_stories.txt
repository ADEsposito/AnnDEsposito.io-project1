1. As a user, I want to click on zombie heads, and receive a score for those I successfully "hunt", so that I can waste time in an enjoyable manner

2. As an admin, I want to create a fun way to spend time "killing" zombies that calculates your score based on the number of successful clicks on zombie heads that "fall" down the screen at a variable speed

Potential Ideas
- add additional levels of increasing difficulty (more zombies? less bullets?)
- add random power ups that the user can click to gain additional "bullets"
- add random "boss" zombies that would require more than one click to "kill" but would provide additional points
- add sound effects and music
